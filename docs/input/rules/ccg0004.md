 > Cake-reference has not set `PrivateAssets="all"`

## Cause

This error is raised, when one of the following packages is referenced without having `PrivateAssets="all"` set.

* Cake.Addin.Analyzer
* Cake.Common
* Cake.Core
* CakeContrib.Guidelines

## Description

References to `Cake.Core` or `Cake.Common` are usually only used for local compilation and should not
be exposed to consuming packages.

References to `Cake.Addin.Analyzer` and `CakeContrib.Guidelines` are only used to analyze the current project and 
should never be exposed to consuming packages.

## How to fix violations

Add the attribute `PrivateAssets="all"` to all required references.
(Or opt-out of this rule, by setting `CakeContribGuidelinesCakeReferenceOmitPrivateCheck`)
