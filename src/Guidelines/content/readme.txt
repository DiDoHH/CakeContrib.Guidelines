Thanks for installing CakeContrib.Guidelines.

MIGRATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION?
We've eliminated the need to have a project-local copy of
the Cake-Contrib icon.

You can - if you like - remove the <PackageIcon> and <PackageIconUrl>
tags from the csproj, as well as the local copy of the icon.

Is there more?
Yes. Read the docs at https://github.com/cake-contrib/CakeContrib.Guidelines/
